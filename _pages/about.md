I'm a second year PhD student from [Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR), Tsinghua University](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yaqin Zhang](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1046/1188.htm), [Prof. Yunxin Liu](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1046/1193.htm), and [Prof. Yuanchun Li](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1046/1200.htm).

My research interest includes edge computing and AI for systems. Currently, I am interested in building personal assistant powered by edge LLMs. Check out our [position & survey paper](https://github.com/MobileLLM/Personal_LLM_Agents_Survey/).
